        <p>
          I recieved my Full-Stack Web Development certificate from the UCSD Coding Bootcamp.
          It was a fast-paced program that taught me the skills I need to be a successful web developer. This bootcamp provided me with knowlege in many topics, such as Agile Development, Object-Oriented Programming, Git version control, MERN stack development and much more. I am very eager and determined to continue growing my skills as a web developer! I have always loved to learn and I know there are still many ways to improve in this field. Below you will find some of the projects I have worked on during my time in the bootcamp.
